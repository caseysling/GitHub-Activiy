Live on Dancing With The Stars...
Derek and Courtney were practicing all week for their next dance in the "tango".
Their scores last week for their "cha-cha" was lower than expected, so they really wanted to up their game...
And I mean UP!!
The tango is already a very fast moving dance, but Derek and Courtney decided to add in some throws and lifts to increase their difficulty points.
Now, they are getting ready to go on stage! Let's see if their hard work pays off!
Derek and Courtney give each other a hug and wished each other good luck before going onto the stage. 
They started dancing as the music begins.
Everything goes smoothly, but all of a sudden Derek realized that he forgets about the dance move...
As his blood pressure rises, his mind started to panic. 
He has to make a decision within milliseconds.
But, his body suddenly froze. But then he start to think why he started to dance. 
It was his passion, he wanted to make it to the top and wanted people to see his dance. 
So, his body start to move as his mind was blank. 
At the end of the dance the judges cried as they will able to feel the passion in there dance. 
And got a perfect score and the rest was .... history.
