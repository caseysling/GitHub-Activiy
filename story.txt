Live on Dancing With The Stars...
Derek and Courtney were practicing all week for their next dance in the "tango".
Their scores last week for their "cha-cha" was lower than expected, so they really wanted to up their game...
And I mean UP!!
The tango is already a very fast moving dance, but Derek and Courtney decided to add in some throws and lifts to increase their difficulty points.
Now, they are getting ready to go on stage! Let's see if their hard work pays off!
